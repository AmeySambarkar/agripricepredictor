🌾 Commodity Price Prediction Web App
This project is a web-based application for predicting commodity prices using machine learning (CatBoost). The app is built using Streamlit for the frontend and backend integration. It allows users to input the district, commodity, and date to predict future prices of agricultural commodities.

🖥️ Features
Machine Learning Model: CatBoost-based model for predicting commodity prices.
Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
Custom Input Fields: Users can input the district, commodity name, and date to get a predicted price.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the input data before making predictions.
Historical Price Trends: (Optional) Display historical price data for commodities.
Visuals & Styling: Enhancements to make the app visually appealing and interactive.
🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit for the user interface.
Backend: CatBoost model for price prediction.
Data: CSV datasets with historical commodity price data.
Visualization: Plotly for interactive data visualization.
🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.7+
Pip (Python package installer)
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/commodity-price-prediction.git
cd commodity-price-prediction
Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
Place your CSV datasets in a folder named datasets in the root directory of the project. The application will automatically read the CSV files during execution.

Run the App Locally
Run the Streamlit app locally using the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will start the app, and it will be accessible at http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.

Optional: Customizing App Theme
To customize the app's appearance, you can modify the .streamlit/config.toml file to define custom colors and fonts:

toml
Copy code
[theme]
primaryColor="#4CAF50"
backgroundColor="#FFFFFF"
secondaryBackgroundColor="#F0F2F6"
textColor="#262730"
font="sans serif"
🧑‍💻 How to Use the App
Open the web app in your browser (http://localhost:8501).
Enter the District Name, Commodity Name, and Date using the input fields.
Click the Predict button to see the predicted price.
(Optional) View historical price trends in the app if enabled.

⚙️ Model Overview
The machine learning model used for this app is built using CatBoost, a gradient boosting library that excels in handling categorical data. The model is trained on historical commodity prices and uses features like district name, commodity name, and date (with cyclical encoding for date-related features).

Model Training
The model is trained with the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting dates, and feature engineering (cyclical encoding for dates).
Model Selection: Using CatBoost for efficient handling of categorical data.
Feature Engineering: Creating date-related features like month, day of the week, and week of the year.
Training: The model is trained using historical data and saved for future predictions.
📈 Example Data
Ensure that your dataset includes the following columns:

District Name
Market Name
Commodity
Variety
Grade
Min Price (Rs./Quintal)
Max Price (Rs./Quintal)
Modal Price (Rs./Quintal)
Price Date
📊 Sample Prediction Output
After entering your inputs (district, commodity, and date), the app will output a predicted price similar to:

Predicted price for 'Masur Dal' in 'Prayagraj' on 2024-05-26: Rs. 5300.45 per quintal
🚢 Deployment
To deploy this Streamlit app to the cloud (e.g., Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, etc.), follow these steps:

Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
Push the code to a GitHub repository.
Go to Streamlit Cloud.
Link your GitHub repository.
Deploy the app directly from the Streamlit Cloud interface.
Deploy on Heroku
Install the Heroku CLI.

Create a requirements.txt and a Procfile with the following content:

Procfile:

plaintext
Copy code
web: streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT
Push the code to a GitHub repository or directly to Heroku.

Use the Heroku CLI to deploy:

bash
Copy code
heroku create
git push heroku master
heroku open
