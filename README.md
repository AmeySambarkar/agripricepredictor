# üåæ Commodity Price Prediction Web App

This project is a web-based application that predicts commodity prices using machine learning. The app uses **Streamlit** for the frontend and backend integration and allows users to input the district, commodity, and date to predict future prices of agricultural commodities.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Built using **CatBoost** to predict commodity prices.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- **Custom Input Fields**: Enter district, commodity name, and date for a price prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatically preprocesses and cleans input data.
- **Historical Price Trends**: (Optional) Display historical commodity prices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: CatBoost for machine learning model
- **Data**: CSV datasets containing historical commodity price data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7+
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/commodity-price-prediction.git
cd commodity-price-prediction
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the App

To start the Streamlit app locally, run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

### Dataset

Place your CSV datasets (containing historical commodity prices) in a folder named `datasets` in the root directory. The app will read the CSV files automatically.

---

## How to Use

1. Open the app in your web browser (`http://localhost:8501`).
2. Enter the **District Name**, **Commodity Name**, and **Date** using the input fields.
3. Click the **Predict** button to see the predicted price.
4. (Optional) View historical price trends in the app.

## Model Overview

The app uses a **CatBoost** model trained on historical commodity price data. The model predicts future prices based on district, commodity, and date, using features like cyclical date encoding.

### Model Training Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and feature engineering for date-related features.
2. **Model Selection**: **CatBoost** is used for handling categorical and numerical data efficiently.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Date features like month, day of the week, and week of the year are encoded.
4. **Training**: The model is trained on historical price data and saved for future predictions.

## Sample Prediction

After entering the required inputs (district, commodity, and date), the app will display a prediction like:

```
Predicted price for 'Masur Dal' in 'Prayagraj' on 2024-05-26: Rs. 5300.45 per quintal
```

## Deployment

You can deploy the Streamlit app using one of the following methods:

### Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/).
3. Link your GitHub repository and deploy the app.

### Deploy on Heroku

1. Install the Heroku CLI.
2. Add a `requirements.txt` and a `Procfile` to your project directory.

**Procfile:**

```plaintext
web: streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT
```

3. Push your code to a Heroku app:

```bash
heroku create
git push heroku master
heroku open
```
